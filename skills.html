        <h3>Blogging</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I wrote my first blog when I was in the 8th grade. I began with compiling all my poems , limericks as well as some messages in te form of thoughts.
              The theme of the blog was to tell my views about how I look towards life. The link to the same is as follows:-<br />
            <a href="http://learnaboutlife1.blogspot.com/">MY POEMS & THOUGHTS</a> </li>
            <li>I started the second blog in the first year of my B Tech course. The purpose of the same was to provide knowledge regarding various fields ranging right from astronomy to history to art & design.
              As in I get deep into these topics, I document them and put it in there. The link for the blog is:-
  <br /><a href="https://theexplorerzone.blogspot.com/2021/03/exo-planets-are-we-humans-alone-in.html">LET'S EXPLORE</a>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Art and Design</h3>
        <p>I have always been interested in hand made designs which include zectangles, doodles and many more pttern arts. Lately I started learning photoshop and video editing skills.
        You might want to contact me if you share common interest and thus we can exchange our art knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Web-development</h3>
        <p>Learnt html and Javascript for 2 years during High School. In my first yearm I am exploring the competitive programming languages like c and c++.
        Also I am diving deep into web development by gaining more knowledge on css and bootstrap.<br />Here is a website I made using html, css and Javascript; a "To Do List" :-

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>Photography is my hobby, which has no specific time or place to be followed. What you need is just an innovative perspective of your environment and a camera.
        Thats how I have captured multiple beautiful pictures wherever I have been. Again we could exchange our knowledge and photos.</p>
